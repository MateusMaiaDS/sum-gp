# Sum-GP
Simple code to compute the sum of Gaussian Processes

The following files are :
- `sum_gp_scratch_motivation.R`: is the main file code to generate the simulated data and generate the results that I created with the `rbase` functions
- `fast_multiple_tau.R`: main function to generate Gaussian Process

The directories have the JAGS and rbase functions.

To generate the JAGS model, it only need to run the file in the jags directory
- `jags_sum_gps.R`
